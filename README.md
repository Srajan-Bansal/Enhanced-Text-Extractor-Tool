> Develop an Enhanced Text Extraction and Enrichment tool for text extraction and data enrichment. The tool will be implemented as a web application using React.js/Node.js stack. It will allow users to upload files, extract text from PDF formats, enrich the extracted data using AI, and display the processed results in an interactive format.
