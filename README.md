> Develop an Enhanced Text Extraction and Enrichment tool that utilizes the Langchain library for text extraction and OpenAI for data enrichment. The tool will be implemented as a web application using Next.js/React.js/Node.js stack. It will allow users to upload files, extract text from PDF formats, enrich the extracted data using OpenAI, and display the processed results in an interactive table format.
