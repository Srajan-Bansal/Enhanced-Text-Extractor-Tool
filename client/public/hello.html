			is a collection of independent computers that appear to the users of
			the <br />system as a single coherent system.<br />A distributed
			system is a collection of autonomous computers linked by a computer
			network that <br />appear to the users of the system as a single
			computer.<br />A distributed system consists of a collection of
			autonomous computers, connected through a <br />network and
			distribution middleware, which enables computers to coordinate their
			activities and to <br />share the resources of the system, so that
			users perceive the system as a single, integrated <br />computing
			facility.<br />Introduction:<br /><br />Introduction:<br />&bull;<br />A&nbsp;distributed
			system&nbsp;is a system whose components are <br />located on
			different&nbsp;networked computers, which communicate <br />and
			coordinate their actions by&nbsp;passing messages&nbsp;to one
			<br />another.<br />&bull;<br />Distributed computing&nbsp;is a
			field of&nbsp;computer science&nbsp;that <br />studies distributed
			systems.<br />&bull;<br />The word&nbsp;distributed&nbsp;in terms
			such as <br />"distributed system", "distributed <br />programming",
			and "distributed algorithm" <br />originally referred to computer
			networks <br />where individual computers were physically
			<br />distributed within some geographical area.<br />&bull;<br />T
			h e r e a r e s e v e r a l a u t o n o m o u s <br />computational
			entities (computers or nodes), <br />each of which has its own local
			memory.<br />&bull;<br />The entities communicate with each other by
			<br />message passing.<br /><br />&bull;<br />Distributed systems
			are a collection of independent components and <br />machines
			located on different systems, communicating in order to
			<br />operate as a single unit.<br />&bull;<br />Distributed System
			is a collection of autonomous computer systems that <br />are
			physically separated but are connected by a centralized computer
			<br />network that is equipped with distributed system software. The
			<br />autonomous computers will communicate among each system by
			<br />sharing resources and files and performing the tasks assigned
			to them.<br />Introduction:<br /><br />A distributed system is a
			network of interconnected computers that enhances user experience,
			resource utilization, <br />scalability, reliability, and
			performance.<br />1: Boosting Performance:<br />
